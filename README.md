Hi! I am a 2nd-year graduate student in the [Cognitive Computing Lab](http://nlp.jbnu.ac.kr/) at Jeonbuk National University. Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Seung-Hoon Na](http://nlp.jbnu.ac.kr/~nash/faculty.html). Prior to Jeonbuk National University, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Kookmin University in Feb 2021, also completed of first phase certification of Software Maestro 6th from the government of the Republic of Korea in Dec 2015.

During my M.S., I've been fortunate to be an intern at [NAVER Corporation](https://www.navercorp.com/), one of the biggest companies in the IT area from the Republic of Korea.
