Hi! I am a 2nd-year graduate student in the [Cognitive Computing Lab](http://nlp.jbnu.ac.kr/) at Jeonbuk National University. Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by [Seunghoon Na](http://nlp.jbnu.ac.kr/~nash/faculty.html). Prior to Jeonbuk National University, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Kookmin University in Feb 2021, also completed of first phase certification of Software Maestro 6th from the government of the Republic of Korea in Dec 2015.

My research area is Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I am interested in generating text with reducing hallucinated facts by controllable components and suggesting robust prompt design such as P-tuning, etc.

During my M.S., I've been fortunate to be an intern at [NAVER Corporation](https://www.navercorp.com/), one of the biggest companies in the IT area from the Republic of Korea.
