Hi! I am a 1st-year graduate student in the [Cognitive Computing Lab](http://nlp.jbnu.ac.kr/) at Jeonbuk National University. Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by [Seunghoon Na](http://nlp.jbnu.ac.kr/~nash/faculty.html). Prior to Jeonbuk National University, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Kookmin University in Feb 2021, also a certification of Software Maestro 6th from the government of the Republic of Korea in Dec 2015.
